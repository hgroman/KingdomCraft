## Handoff Document: Resuming MJML Component Creation

**Date:** 2025-05-15 20:43:20 UTC
**From:** AI Assistant (MJML Developer Persona)
**To:** Future AI Assistant / Self
**Subject:** Resuming Work Order `WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md`

This document outlines the current status and next steps for completing the MJML component creation and documentation as detailed in Work Order `WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md`.

### 1. Current Status & Context

*   **Active Work Order:** `work_orders/WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md`
*   **Active Persona:** MJML Developer
*   **Primary Input Document:** `work_orders/completed/mjml_component_analysis_report.md`
*   **Key Guiding Principles:** Adhere to `README.md`, especially "AI Onboarding & Context Anchoring Protocol" and "Iterative Process Adherence & Collaborative Pacing".
*   **Target Component Directory Structure (from analysis report via WO):
    ```
    templates/components/
    ├── common/
    ├── structure/
    └── content/
    ```
    And a corresponding structure under `docs/components/`.

### 2. Work Completed So Far

The following components have had their `.mjml` and `.md` (documentation) files created and placed into the corrected directory structure. Initial file moves and path corrections in docs are complete for these items:

1.  **`va-header-logo.mjml`**
    *   MJML: `templates/components/structure/va-header-logo.mjml`
    *   Doc: `docs/components/structure/va-header-logo.md`
2.  **`va-hero-banner.mjml`**
    *   MJML: `templates/components/structure/va-hero-banner.mjml`
    *   Doc: `docs/components/structure/va-hero-banner.md`
3.  **`va-title-divider.mjml`**
    *   MJML: `templates/components/common/va-title-divider.mjml`
    *   Doc: `docs/components/common/va-title-divider.md`

**The following components have been created BUT their directory cleanup is IN PROGRESS:**

4.  **`va-text-intro.mjml`**
    *   MJML created at: `templates/components/content/va-text-intro.mjml` (Correct final location after internal move)
    *   Doc needs to be moved/created at: `docs/components/content/va-text-intro.md` (Old one at `docs/components/content_blocks/va-text-intro.md`)
5.  **`va-callout-highlight.mjml`**
    *   MJML created at: `templates/components/content/va-callout-highlight.mjml` (Correct final location after internal move)
    *   Doc needs to be moved/created at: `docs/components/content/va-callout-highlight.md` (Old one at `docs/components/content_blocks/va-callout-highlight.md`)

### 3. Immediate Next Steps (Where I Left Off - CRITICAL TO COMPLETE THESE FIRST)

1.  **Delete Obsolete `va-text-intro.mjml`:**
    *   File: `templates/components/content_blocks/va-text-intro.mjml`
2.  **Finalize `va-text-intro.md` Documentation:**
    *   Create/Move to: `docs/components/content/va-text-intro.md`.
    *   Ensure content is correct and `Location:` path updated to `templates/components/content/va-text-intro.mjml`.
    *   Delete old doc: `docs/components/content_blocks/va-text-intro.md`.
3.  **Delete Obsolete `va-callout-highlight.mjml`:**
    *   File: `templates/components/content_blocks/va-callout-highlight.mjml`
4.  **Finalize `va-callout-highlight.md` Documentation:**
    *   Create/Move to: `docs/components/content/va-callout-highlight.md`.
    *   Ensure content is correct and `Location:` path updated to `templates/components/content/va-callout-highlight.mjml`.
    *   Delete old doc: `docs/components/content_blocks/va-callout-highlight.md`.
5.  **Delete Empty Legacy Directories:**
    *   `templates/components/headers/`
    *   `docs/components/headers/`
    *   `templates/components/banners/`
    *   `docs/components/banners/`
    *   `templates/components/content_blocks/`
    *   `docs/components/content_blocks/`

### 4. Resuming New Component Creation

Once the directory cleanup above is fully completed:

*   Proceed to **Component 6: Feature Card (`va-feature-card.mjml`)** from the `mjml_component_analysis_report.md`.
*   Place its `.mjml` file in `templates/components/content/va-feature-card.mjml`.
*   Place its `.md` documentation in `docs/components/content/va-feature-card.md`.
*   Continue sequentially through all remaining components listed in the `mjml_component_analysis_report.md` (Components 7 through 13).
    *   Use the categories (`common/`, `structure/`, `content/`) as defined in the analysis report for placing component and documentation files.
    *   Ensure documentation for each component is comprehensive as per the Work Order.

### 5. Completion of Work Order

*   After all components are created and documented:
    *   Prepare a draft journal entry summarizing all work performed for `WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md`.
    *   List all created component and documentation files in the journal entry.
    *   Update the status of `WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md` to `Review` or `Done` in `tasks.yml` (pending Architect review).
    *   Notify the MJML Component Architect (the user) that the work order is complete and the journal entry is ready for review.

Adherence to the project's established workflow and meticulous documentation is paramount.
