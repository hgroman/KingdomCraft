This document summarizes the state of the project following the completion of tasks outlined in the previous handoff document `Handoff/2025-05-15_204320_WO-COMP-CREATE-001_InProgress.md`.

### 1. Work Completed in This Session

All tasks associated with Work Order `WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md` (now identified as `TASK001` in `tasks.yml`) have been successfully executed. This includes:

*   **Directory and File Cleanup:** All cleanup tasks specified in Section 3 of the prior handoff document were addressed. This involved deleting obsolete files and moving/updating documentation to the correct locations for `va-text-intro` and `va-callout-highlight`.
*   **New Component Creation:** Components 6 through 13, as listed in the `mjml_component_analysis_report.md`, were created. This involved generating both the `.mjml` files (in `templates/components/...`) and their corresponding `.md` documentation files (in `docs/components/...`), adhering to the categorized directory structure.
*   **Project Management Updates:**
    *   A detailed journal entry documenting all actions taken has been created: `journal/2025-05-15_205938_Completed-WO-MJML-Component-Initial-Doc.md`.
    *   The `journal_index.yml` has been updated to include this new entry.
    *   The `tasks.yml` file has been updated; `TASK001` (representing `WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md`) is now marked as `done`.

### 2. Current Status

*   The initial set of 13 MJML components defined in `mjml_component_analysis_report.md` are now created and documented.
*   The project's component library has been significantly advanced.
*   All procedural steps for closing out this work order (journaling, task update) are complete.

### 3. Next Steps for Future AI Assistant

*   **Review `journal/2025-05-15_205938_Completed-WO-MJML_Component-Initial-Doc.md`** for a comprehensive list of all files created, modified, or deleted during this session.
*   **Consult `tasks.yml`** for any newly assigned tasks or to understand the current project backlog.
*   As `TASK001` is complete, await new instructions or work orders from the MJML Component Architect (User) regarding the next phase of development for the Email Template System. This might involve:
    *   Creating new email templates using the established components.
    *   Developing additional components based on new requirements.
    *   Refining existing components or documentation.
    *   Initiating the next Work Order as per project plans.

This session concludes the work defined by `Handoff/2025-05-15_204320_WO-COMP-CREATE-001_InProgress.md`.
