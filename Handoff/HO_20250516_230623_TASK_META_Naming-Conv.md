**Date:** 2025-05-16 23:06:23 UTC
**From:** AI Assistant
**Regarding:** Completion of Work Order `WO_TASK_META_CONSOLIDATION_20250517` (related to `TASK_META`).

## Summary of Changes:

This session focused on executing `WO_TASK_META_CONSOLIDATION_20250517` to standardize file naming conventions and update related project documentation. The new authoritative naming conventions are now in effect and documented.

### New Authoritative Naming Conventions:

*   **Task (Master Record):**
    *   Location: Entry in `tasks.yml`.
    *   ID Format: `TASK###`.
    *   Rule: Always create **first**.

*   **Work Order:**
    *   Filename Pattern: `WO_<TASKID>_<YYYYMMDD>_<3-5-word-label>.md`
    *   Folder: `work_orders/active/` -> `work_orders/completed/`.
    *   Date is `YYYYMMDD`.

*   **Journal Entry:**
    *   Filename Pattern: `JE_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>_<TASKID>_<1-3-word-summary>.md`
    *   Folder: `journal/`.
    *   Timestamp is UTC `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`.

### Key Actions Taken:

1.  **`TASK_META` created** in `tasks.yml` and marked `done`.
2.  **Journal files renamed:** Existing journal files were renamed to the new `JE_...` format, incorporating their assigned `TASKID`.
3.  **`journal_index.yml` updated:** Reflects new journal filenames.
4.  **Documentation updated:**
    *   `docs/guides/Work_Order_Process.md`: Examples updated to new WO and JE filename patterns.
    *   `README.md`: Journal filename examples updated; "Learning from Past Failures" section condensed.
5.  **Journal Entry for `TASK_META` created:** `journal/JE_20250516_230523_TASK_META_Meta-Rules-Applied.md` details all changes.
6.  **`tasks.yml` updated:** `TASK_META` status set to `done`; other tasks linked to their latest journal entries.

## Next Steps:

*   All future Work Orders and Journal Entries should strictly adhere to these new naming conventions.
*   The project `WO_TASK_META_CONSOLIDATION_20250517` is now ready for archival.
*   The primary focus can return to pending tasks, such as the "MJML Component Cleanup" which requires a new Work Order (to be named according to the new convention).

This concludes the execution of `WO_TASK_META_CONSOLIDATION_20250517`.
