# Handoff: Legacy Asset Audit and Archival Complete

- **Date:** 2025-06-11 15:56:00 UTC
- **From:** AI Assistant (Cascade)
- **Regarding:** Completion of `WO002` (related to `TASK002`).

## Summary of Outcome

`TASK002` is now complete. The legacy asset audit was successfully performed, and the `Archive-Legacy` directory has been archived by renaming it to `Archive-Legacy_ARCHIVED_20250611`. This action cleans up the project repository, separating obsolete files from the active MJML workflow.

## Detailed Documentation

- **Audit Report:** All findings from the audit are documented in `docs/legacy_asset_audit_report.md`.
- **Journal Entry:** A full record of the actions taken to complete this task is available in `journal/JE_20250611_155500_TASK002_Legacy-Audit-Done.md`.

## Next Steps

The project is now free of legacy clutter in the main directories. The only remaining task is `TASK001`, which is in `Review` status.

Awaiting a new Work Order or further instructions.
