## 1. Task Summary
This task involved converting a Markdown blog post ("Revolutionary Advancement: DAX Copilot Introduces Specialty-Specific AI Models") into a self-contained HTML file. The HTML was styled according to Voice Automated branding (referenced from `Recent Voice Auto Page for Style Guide.html`) and prepared for embedding into a WordPress Elementor widget. SEO metadata recommendations for the hero image were also provided.

## 2. Work Performed & Key Decisions
*   A new Work Order (`WO_TASK_BLOG001_20250611_Blog-Post-DAX-Copilot-HTML.md`) was created to manage this task.
*   Styles were extracted from `work_orders/active/Recent Voice Auto Page for Style Guide.html` and applied to the blog post HTML.
*   The generated HTML (`work_orders/active/dax_copilot_blog_post.html`) was iteratively refined based on USER feedback to ensure proper integration with the WordPress theme (specifically, removing a redundant hero section).
*   SEO recommendations (filename, alt text, image title, image description) were provided for the blog post's hero image.
*   The USER successfully implemented the HTML, made further client-requested image adjustments, and published the blog post.

## 3. Deliverables
*   **Primary Deliverable:** `work_orders/active/dax_copilot_blog_post.html` (Final HTML code for the blog post).
*   **Supporting Documents:**
    *   `work_orders/active/WO_TASK_BLOG001_20250611_Blog-Post-DAX-Copilot-HTML.md`
    *   `journal/JE_20250612_080200_TASK_BLOG001_WordPress_Blog_Post_HTML_Conversion_Complete.md`

## 4. Current Status & Next Steps
*   **Task Status:** Done.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   The Work Order `WO_TASK_BLOG001` will be moved to the `work_orders/archive/` directory.
    *   The client will provide final feedback on the published blog post directly to the USER.

## 5. Learnings & Recommendations
*   The Project Governor persona's initial asset scan should be more comprehensive to identify existing relevant files (e.g., style guides) within active project directories.
*   When generating embeddable HTML, it's crucial to clarify how it will integrate with the parent platform's theme (e.g., handling of titles, featured images) to minimize rework.
