## 1. Task Summary
This strategic task, "Project Bezalel," (The Bezalel Framework) established a formal framework for quantifying effort and value within the KingdomCraft project. It shifted the project's core mindset from time-based tracking to value-based tracking, recognizing that AI-assisted workflows amplify strategic impact.

## 2. Work Performed & Key Decisions
*   A new Work Order (`WO_TASK_BEZALEL001...`) was created to scope and track the initiative.
*   A foundational philosophy document, `docs/guides/Effort_And_Value_Philosophy.md`, was created to codify the project's value-centric principles.
*   The Project Governor persona was updated to require a review of this philosophy during its initialization, embedding the principles into its core operational logic.
*   A new `meta_analysis/` directory was created to house process improvement artifacts.
*   The first meta-analysis report, `MA_20250612_Project-Bezalel-Framework-Analysis.md`, was drafted to analyze the session's evolution from a simple test to a strategic framework implementation.

## 3. Deliverables
*   **Primary Deliverables:**
    *   `docs/guides/Effort_And_Value_Philosophy.md`
    *   `meta_analysis/MA_20250612_Project-Bezalel-Framework-Analysis.md`
    *   Updates to `persona_prompts/1. emailforge_project_governor_persona.md`
*   **Supporting Documents:**
    *   `work_orders/archive/WO_TASK_BEZALEL001_20250612_Project-Bezalel-Framework.md`
    *   `journal/JE_20250612_082500_TASK_BEZALEL001_Project_Bezalel_Framework_Established.md`

## 4. Current Status & Next Steps
*   **Task Status:** Done.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   The Work Order `WO_TASK_BEZALEL001` has been moved to the `work_orders/archive/` directory.
    *   All future project work will be conducted under the principles established by Project Bezalel (The Bezalel Framework).

## 5. Learnings & Recommendations
*   This task itself is a learning. It demonstrates the importance of a "Plan > Execute > Reflect > Evolve Framework" cycle.
*   Formalizing core philosophies and strategic frameworks provides crucial guardrails for AI-assisted project management, ensuring consistency and alignment with high-level goals.
