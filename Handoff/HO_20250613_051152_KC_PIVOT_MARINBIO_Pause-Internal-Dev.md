*   **Date:** 2025-06-13
*   **Timestamp (UTC):** 05:11:52
*   **From:** KingdomCraft Steward (AI)
*   **To:** Future Self / Next AI Persona Instance
*   **Associated Task(s):** TASK_KC_ARCHITECTURE_PHASE2 (Conceptual), TASK_MARINBIO_ONBOARD_INIT (Conceptual)

## 1. Current Project Status (KingdomCraft Internal Development)

*   **KingdomCraft Rebrand:** Successfully COMPLETED. All project assets, documentation, and personas are updated to "KingdomCraft" branding and The Bezalel Framework philosophy.
*   **Last Active Internal Goal:** The immediate next step in the KingdomCraft master plan was to "Define new architecture for multi-client management, tools, and knowledge bases."
*   **Current State:** This internal architectural work is now PAUSED.

## 2. Reason for Pause & Strategic Pivot

A strategic decision has been made to prioritize the onboarding of a new client, **MarinBio**. This initiative provides an immediate, practical application for the KingdomCraft framework and an opportunity to develop a new client-specific persona.

## 3. Active Initiative: MarinBio Client Onboarding

*   **Objective:** To fully onboard MarinBio, establish a deep understanding of their brand and needs, and develop initial strategic marketing materials.
*   **Key Activities Underway/Planned:**
    1.  Definition and creation of a "MarinBio Client Steward" persona.
    2.  Comprehensive information gathering about MarinBio.
    3.  Development of a 6-month white paper plan.
    4.  Crafting a press release to announce the white paper plan.
*   **Relevant Documentation:**
    *   Journal Entry: `JE_20250613_051152_KC_REBRAND_COMPLETE_MARINBIO_PIVOT_Strategic-Pivot-to-MarinBio.md`
    *   (Forthcoming) MarinBio Client Steward Persona: `persona_prompts/3.marinbio_client_steward_persona.md`
    *   (Forthcoming) Work Order for MarinBio onboarding.

## 4. Instructions for Resuming KingdomCraft Internal Architecture

When resuming the internal development of KingdomCraft (TASK_KC_ARCHITECTURE_PHASE2 or similar):

1.  **Review:**
    *   This Handoff document.
    *   The `JE_20250613_051152_KC_REBRAND_COMPLETE_MARINBIO_PIVOT_Strategic-Pivot-to-MarinBio.md`.
    *   The overall project plan in `tasks.yml` (as it stood before this pivot, and its state upon completion of the MarinBio initial phase).
    *   The `README.md` and core documentation for KingdomCraft.
2.  **Assess:** Evaluate any learnings or new requirements identified during the MarinBio engagement that might influence the multi-client architecture.
3.  **Proceed:** Continue with the task "Define new architecture for multi-client management, tools, and knowledge bases," incorporating any new insights.

## 5. Open Questions / Considerations for Future Self

*   How will the MarinBio "Client Steward" persona and its knowledge base integrate with or inform the broader multi-client architecture?
*   Are there specific tools or knowledge management techniques developed for MarinBio that can be generalized for KingdomCraft?
