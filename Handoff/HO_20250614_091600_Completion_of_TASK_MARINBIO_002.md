## 1. Summary of Work Completed

We have successfully executed and completed all objectives for `TASK_MARINBIO_002`. This task focused on internal process improvement and has resulted in a significant enhancement of our project's organizational structure and the formalization of key strategic assets.

**Key accomplishments include:**
*   **Standardized Folder Structure:** The entire MarinBio project has been reorganized into a new, standard folder structure. This is now the blueprint for all future client projects.
*   **Formal Documentation:** The new structure is documented in `docs/guides/Standard_Client_Folder_Structure.md`.
*   **New System Persona:** The "Keeper of the Estate" persona has been created (`personas/system/kingdomcraft_estate_keeper_persona.md`) to manage and enforce organizational hygiene.
*   **Client Communication Draft:** A value-driven summary of Phase 1 progress has been drafted and is ready for your review at `clients/MarinBio/04_communication/Phase1_Progress_Summary_Draft.md`.

## 2. Current Project State

*   The MarinBio project is fully organized and all related artifacts are consolidated under `clients/MarinBio/`.
*   The documentation protocol for this task is nearly complete, with only the Work Order archival and `tasks.yml` update remaining.
*   The project is now perfectly positioned to transition from foundational work to the content creation phase as outlined in the initial MarinBio strategy.

## 3. Proposed Next Steps

1.  Archive the Work Order for `TASK_MARINBIO_002`.
2.  Update `tasks.yml` to close `TASK_MARINBIO_002`.
3.  Begin work on the next active task: creating the first white paper for MarinBio.
