---

## 1. Summary of Work Completed

We have successfully completed the initial definition phase for `TASK_PERSONA_DEV_001`. This involved establishing the foundational documents for two new system-level AI personas requested by the USER: the Client Communication Specialist and the Strategic Billing & Value Specialist.

**Key deliverables include:**
*   **Client Communication Persona:**
    *   Prompt: `personas/system/client_communication_persona.md`
    *   Guide: `docs/guides/Client_Communication_Persona_Guide.md`
*   **Strategic Billing & Value Specialist Persona:**
    *   Prompt: `personas/system/strategic_billing_persona.md`
    *   Guide: `docs/guides/Strategic_Billing_Persona_Guide.md`
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   A general framework for testing these personas is outlined in `docs/guides/System_Persona_Testing_Strategy.md`.
*   All associated project management artifacts (Work Order, Task in `tasks.yml`, Journal Entry) have been created.

## 2. Current Project State

*   The initial prompts and user guides for the two new system personas are complete and available in the project repository.
*   The next logical step for these personas, as per the testing strategy, would be interactive scenario-based testing and refinement. This will be handled as a separate follow-up activity.
*   The documentation protocol for this definition phase is nearly complete.

## 3. Proposed Next Steps

1.  Archive the Work Order for `TASK_PERSONA_DEV_001`.
2.  Update `tasks.yml` to close `TASK_PERSONA_DEV_001` (marking the *definition* phase as complete).
3.  Consider initiating a new task specifically for the interactive testing and refinement of these personas if desired.

## 4. Open Questions / Blockers

*   None for the definition phase. The project is ready for the next stage of persona development (testing and iteration) or other strategic priorities.
