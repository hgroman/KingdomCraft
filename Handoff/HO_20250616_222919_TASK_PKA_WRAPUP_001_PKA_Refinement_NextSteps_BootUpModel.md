# Handoff Document

**Date:** 2025-06-16
**Timestamp (UTC):** 20250616_222919
**From:** Cascade (AI Assistant Session)
**To:** Next KingdomCraft Steward / Project Team
**Subject:** Handoff: Persona Knowledge Architecture Refinement & Next Steps for Boot-Up Model
**Associated Task ID (Proposed):** `TASK_PKA_WRAPUP_001`

## 1. Summary of Work Completed in This Session:

*   **Client Onboarding Protocol:**
    *   Refined `docs/guides/Client_Onboarding_Protocol.md` to v1.1, enhancing details on transcript collection, the role of Client Stewards/SMEs in deeper analysis, and the hierarchical persona model.
*   **Client Onboarding Specialist Persona:**
    *   Strategically defined and created `personas/client_onboarding_specialist_persona.md` to execute the onboarding protocol.
*   **MarinBio Persona File Management (Corrective Actions):**
    *   Relocated `3.marinbio_client_steward_persona.md` to the correct user-specified path: `clients/MarinBio/3.marinbio_client_steward_persona.md`.
    *   Deleted incorrectly created directories: `personas/clients/MarinBio/` and `personas/clients/`.
    *   Deleted the original MarinBio persona file from `personas/`.
*   **Manifest & Documentation Updates:**
    *   Updated `personas/manifests/1.kingdomcraft_steward.md` to correctly reference the new path for the MarinBio Client Steward persona.
    *   Reviewed other manifest files (`billing_and_value_steward.md`, `file_structure_architect.md`, `system_documentation_steward.md`) and `docs/guides/Multi-LLM_Interaction_Model.md`; confirmed no further path updates were needed for the MarinBio persona relocation.
*   **Process Clarifications:**
    *   Acknowledged and corrected misunderstanding regarding the prior definition of Client Profile structures (already detailed in `Client_Onboarding_Protocol.md`).
    *   Received and noted critical user directive: **AI must NOT create any directories without explicit prior user approval.**

## 2. Current Project State:

*   The foundational elements for client onboarding (protocol, specialist persona) are established.
*   Client-specific persona files (like MarinBio's) are intended to reside directly within their respective `clients/[ClientName]/` directories.
*   Core persona manifest files in `personas/manifests/` are largely accurate in pointing to system-level personas and the `KingdomCraft Steward` manifest now correctly points to the MarinBio persona.

## 3. Key Outstanding Tasks (for next session):

*   **Primary Focus: Enhance `docs/guides/Multi-LLM_Interaction_Model.md`:**
    *   **Strategically define and document the enhanced persona boot-up sequence.** This needs to explicitly cover:
        *   **Client Context Determination:** How does the system (or the `KingdomCraft Steward`) determine which client context is active when a session begins or shifts focus?
        *   **Client-Specific Knowledge Loading:** How does a `[ClientName] Client Steward Persona` (e.g., `clients/MarinBio/3.marinbio_client_steward_persona.md`) load its specific client profile documents (from `clients/[ClientName]/profile/`), transcripts, and source materials? This needs to be integrated into the boot-up logic.
        *   **SME Sub-Persona Orchestration:** How does a Client Steward activate and provide necessary context (client-specific and task-specific) to specialized Subject Matter Expert (SME) sub-personas?
        *   **Integration of New Roles:** How does the `Client Onboarding Specialist Persona` fit into the overall interaction model, particularly regarding the handover of a newly completed client profile to the `KingdomCraft Steward` for activation of the relevant `[ClientName] Client Steward Persona`?
*   **Supporting Tasks (Review & Refine):**
    *   Final review of all active persona names for clarity, function, and consistent naming conventions (consider workflow-based ordering/prefixing if beneficial).
    *   Verify all manifest files in `personas/manifests/` correctly point to persona definitions and remain concise.

## 4. Open Questions & Points for Next Session:

*   What is the preferred mechanism for the `KingdomCraft Steward` to determine/switch active client contexts? (e.g., user prompt, analysis of `tasks.yml`, recent journal entries?)
*   How granular should the `Multi-LLM_Interaction_Model.md` be in describing the loading of individual client profile documents versus pointing to the `Client_Onboarding_Protocol.md` for the list of standard profile files?

## 5. Relevant Files for Next Steps:

*   `docs/guides/Multi-LLM_Interaction_Model.md` (Primary document for enhancement)
*   `docs/guides/Client_Onboarding_Protocol.md` (Reference for client profile structure)
*   `personas/1.kingdomcraft_steward_persona.md` (Central orchestrator)
*   `personas/client_onboarding_specialist_persona.md`
*   `clients/MarinBio/3.marinbio_client_steward_persona.md` (Example client steward)
*   The latest version of the project plan (accessible via IDE/system context).

This Handoff aims to provide a clear summary and path forward.
