The MarinBio Origin Story
I’ve always known I was going to be a scientist. That path started early — in high school, when I entered the Detroit Science Fair — but it crystallized later, during my chemistry studies at the University of Michigan. That’s when I fell in love with biochemistry — the elegance of it, the complexity, and the way it connects everything in life science.
I pursued graduate studies in biochemistry and expanded into developmental biology during my postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago and Stanford. Being at Stanford, surrounded by innovation — and, frankly, by sunshine and blooming trees in February — made it easy to decide: I was staying in California.
I spent the next decade as a faculty member at UCSF. I trained graduate students and postdocs, collaborated across disciplines, secured funding, and deepened my understanding of drug development and FDA regulations. Along the way, I began consulting for pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations, helping them navigate early-stage drug development.
At one CRO, I was the only scientist besides the CEO. I wrote proposals, ran studies, authored reports, and even submitted GMP assay results to the EPA — which were well received. That experience taught me the science and business of biotech from the ground up.
Eventually, I saw a shift coming. While startups were collapsing around single drug failures, CROs — with revenue based on contract work — were proving more resilient. That’s when I had a realization: I could build something better. Something rooted in real science.
So I started Marin Biologic Laboratories — a research-driven CRO focused on quality, creativity, and scientific integrity.
In the early days, I did it all — assay design, bench work, client calls, and reporting. Within a year, I hired two people. Today, we’re a team of 25 — experienced, innovative, creative and collaborative.
At MarinBio, we’ve always believed that impactful science doesn’t fit neatly into silos. Drug development draws on biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology, and cell biology — often all at once. Our strength is in integrating these fields to build custom assays that support complex programs.
When the biotech downturn hit in 1999–2000, we pivoted fast — moving from discovery research into assay development for preclinical and clinical programs. We mastered GLP and GMP assay development and built a reputation for high-quality, regulatory-compliant work.
Over the ensuing 25 years, we’ve developed hundreds of assays. Our work supports INDs, regulatory submissions, and clinical trials. Far from falling behind, contract research has kept us at the leading edge — because every project brings a new scientific challenge and that is what our clients expect.
What sets us apart? Our team. MarinBio hires senior PhD scientists with deep intuition, who understand both the science and the strategy. We don’t just follow protocols — we build them. In contrast, many scientists fresh out of academia rely on kits without truly grasping the underlying principles.
There’s a myth that contract research is repetitive or uncreative. The truth? It demands innovation, precision, and adaptability every day. We work closely with our clients, solve hard problems, and stay fluent in the latest technologies.
MarinBio is a woman-owned company, based in Novato, California. We’ve been doing cutting-edge science for more than 30 years — and we’re just getting started.
