MarinBio — Science That Thinks With You
At Marin Biologic Laboratories — MarinBio — we don’t just perform assays. We think like scientists, partner like collaborators, and solve like innovators.
Based in Novato, California, MarinBio is a woman-owned contract research organization with more than 30 years of proven success in preclinical and clinical assay development.
Our team includes highly experienced PhD scientists, many with decades of hands-on work in biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, and immunology. We don’t operate in silos — we integrate these disciplines, because your drug development challenges don’t fit into one box either.
What makes us different? We’re proactive. We don’t wait for instructions — we anticipate challenges, ask the right questions, and design the best path forward.
We’re intuitive. With our deep expertise, we know when something doesn’t look right — and we troubleshoot creatively and quickly to keep your project on track.
And we’re communicative. We speak science, but we also speak startup. We stay close to our clients, because we know that the best results come from shared understanding and collaboration.
MarinBio has supported IND filings, developed hundreds of custom assays, and passed FDA and EU audits with zero 483s and observations. We specialize in potency, cell-based, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics assays — and tailor each one to your unique therapeutic.
Whether you’re preparing for clinical trials, validating GMP assays for regulatory submission, or embarking on commercialization of your drug, MarinBio is the partner that thinks alongside you — with precision, flexibility, and scientific vision. We can take your project from the beginning of drug screening, to lot release, stability studies and sample analysis. 
We believe contract research should be anything but routine. At MarinBio, it’s creative, strategic, and always committed to your success.
