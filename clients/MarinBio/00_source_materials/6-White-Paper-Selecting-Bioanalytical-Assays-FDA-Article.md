# Selecting Bioanalytical Assays for FDA Approved Clinical Trials and Commercialization

Robust cell-based potency bioassays are critical to meeting global regulatory requirements for successful clinical studies and the commercialization phase. These assays must provide precise and reliable measurements of therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and pharmacokinetic parameters throughout preclinical and clinical development.

---

## What Are Phase-Appropriate Assays?

Phase-appropriate assays refer to the specific requirements that a bioanalytical assay must satisfy at each stage of drug progression—from preclinical through commercialization. There are **three** stages of assay development:

1. **Stage 1 – Fit for Purpose**
   Demonstration of initial “fit for purpose” to support preclinical work and Phase 1 clinical studies.

2. **Stage 2 – Qualified**
   Intermediate qualification to support Phase 2 clinical studies and process development.

3. **Stage 3 – Validated**
   Full validation to support Phase 3 clinical trials and commercialization (and can be used earlier if needed).

All assays must adhere to FDA and ICH guidelines, emphasizing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and reproducibility, with robust QC/QA oversight to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance.

| **Phase 3 Clinical** | **Stage 3 – Validated:** Meets FDA/EMA/ICH guidelines, GMP/GLP standards, fully documented SOPs with QC/QA oversight; aligns with ICH Q2(R2). | Confirmatory efficacy/safety, lot release, stability |
| **Commercial**       | **Stage 3 – Validated:** Full validation with stringent documentation and compliance; aligns with ICH Q2(R2).                                 | Lot release, stability, post-market testing          |

## Phase-Appropriate Assays: The Key to Regulatory Success

A phase-appropriate framework ensures each assay is tailored to its intended use—whether IND-enabling studies or pivotal clinical trials—by aligning development, qualification, and validation steps with regulatory and business objectives.

---

## Stage 1 – FIT FOR PURPOSE

*Assays for Preclinical and Phase 1 Clinical Studies*

### Setting up the Initial Assay: Tech Transfer or De Novo Development

* **Tech Transfer:** Precisely replicate a well-documented existing assay.
* **De Novo Development:** Build novel assays from literature, commercial kits, or new concepts.
* **Key Steps:** Create a research cell bank; iterate key variables in parallel to optimize conditions quickly, reduce experiments, and control costs.

### Assay Development with Regulatory Readiness

* Refine assays for reproducibility, accuracy, and robustness to meet FDA expectations for IND submissions.

---

## Are You Ready for Your Next Regulatory Step?

In U.S. drug regulation, different applications apply:

* **IND (Investigational New Drug):** Authorization to begin clinical trials in humans.
* **NDA (New Drug Application):** Approval to market a small-molecule drug.
* **ANDA (Abbreviated NDA):** Approval for a generic drug via bioequivalence demonstration.
* **BLA (Biologics License Application):** Approval to market a biologic product (vaccine, monoclonal antibody).

## Stage 2 – QUALIFIED

*Assays for Phase 2 Clinical Studies*

### Should You Select a Qualified or Validated Assay?

Qualification establishes a robust, dose-dependent assay response with defined intermediate precision and accuracy, laying the groundwork for later validation.

### The Qualified Assay

* **3–8 experiments** to evaluate robustness, accuracy, precision, linearity, range, specificity, and stability.
* Aligns with ICH Q2(R2) and FDA bioanalytical guidelines.
* Consultation on long-term storage of reference standards and test samples; creation of GMP-guided Master Cell Banks.

#### Assays Supporting Clinical & Process Development

* At least three replicate experiments; two analysts performing three independent runs each for statistical analysis.
* Option for a qualification report or full GMP documentation (SOPs, workbook, Certificate of Testing).
