**MarinBio Launches Strategic White Paper Series to Guide Biotech Innovators Through Complex Drug Development Landscape**

**Novato, CA – June 13, 2025** – Marin Biologic Laboratories Inc., a leader in bioanalytical testing and regulatory compliance, today announced the launch of a six-month strategic white paper series designed to provide critical guidance to biotech and pharmaceutical innovators. The series, titled "From Discovery to Approval: Navigating the Modern Bioanalytical Journey," will address the most pressing challenges in drug development, from phase-appropriate assay strategy to advanced therapies.

The initiative kicks off in July with a foundational white paper on de-risking the path to IND submission and will continue with monthly releases covering advanced T-cell assays for immuno-oncology, AAV gene therapy potency testing, and best practices for virtual biotech CRO partnerships. This content initiative leverages MarinBio's 30 years of scientific leadership and impeccable regulatory track record to empower companies on their journey from preclinical research to commercialization.

"Our goal has always been to act as a true scientific partner to our clients, especially those pioneering the next generation of therapeutics," said Dr. Tania Weiss, CEO of Marin Biologic Laboratories. "This white paper series is a natural extension of that mission. We are codifying three decades of experience to provide the entire industry with a clear, actionable framework for navigating the immense complexities of modern drug development. We believe that sharing our expertise in regulatory strategy and advanced bioanalysis will help accelerate innovation across the board."

The series will draw upon MarinBio's deep expertise in GMP/GLP-compliant assay development and its recent successes in passing both FDA and EU regulatory audits with zero observations. Each white paper is authored by MarinBio's senior PhD scientists and aims to provide actionable insights for C-suite executives, R&D leaders, and regulatory affairs professionals.

The full schedule of white paper topics is available on the MarinBio website. The first installment will be released in July 2025.
