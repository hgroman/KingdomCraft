### Section 1: The High Stakes of Bioanalytical Failure

*   **Core Concept:** The journey is perilous, and mistakes are costly.

*   **Source Material:**
    *   **From `Selecting_Bioanalytical_Assays_FDA_Article.md`:**
        *   "The assay must be suitable for its intended purpose, a concept known as being 'fit-for-purpose'. As a drug progresses from discovery to preclinical and through Phases 1, 2, and 3 to commercialization, the requirements for the bioanalytical method become more stringent."
        *   "Phase-appropriate assay validation is crucial for regulatory approval of all drugs."
        *   "ICH Q2(R2) and Q14 guidelines provide a framework for the validation of analytical procedures... Adherence to these guidelines is essential for successful regulatory submissions."
    *   **General Theme from Blog Posts:** The complexity of modern therapeutics (immuno-oncology, bispecifics) raises the stakes for assay accuracy and relevance.
