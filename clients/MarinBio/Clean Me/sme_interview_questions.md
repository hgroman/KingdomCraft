### Theme 1: The Stakes & Challenges (for Section 1)

*Goal: To capture real-world stories about the problems clients face.* 

1.  Can you recall a common (but perhaps overlooked) bioanalytical challenge that frequently causes delays for new clients?
2.  Without revealing confidential details, can you describe a situation where a program was at risk due to a non-phase-appropriate assay? What were the consequences?
3.  When a client comes to you to rescue a project, what is the most frequent root cause of their bioanalytical problems?
4.  How have you seen regulatory expectations for assays change over the last 5-10 years? What surprises clients the most about current FDA or EMA scrutiny?

### Theme 2: The MarinBio Blueprint in Action (for Section 2 & 3)

*Goal: To get concrete examples of how MarinBio's philosophy and process work in practice.*

1.  **Regarding "Science That Thinks With You":** Can you give me an example of a time you or a team member asked a client a question they hadn't considered, which ended up saving them from a future problem?
2.  **Regarding the Senior Team:** How does having a senior scientist as the primary point of contact change the dynamic of a project compared to a typical CRO model?
3.  Can you walk me through a time you had to develop a particularly complex assay from scratch (e.g., for a bispecific, ADC, or cell therapy)? What was the key challenge and how did the team solve it?
4.  When you talk about being a "partner" rather than a "vendor," what does that look like on a weekly or monthly basis? Can you give an example of a partnership-in-action?

1.  When you founded MarinBio 30 years ago, what was the specific gap or problem in the CRO industry that you were determined to solve?
2.  The phrase "Science That Thinks With You" is powerful. What personal experience led you to make that the cornerstone of the company's philosophy?
3.  If you could give one piece of advice to a biotech leader about their bioanalytical strategy, what would it be?
4.  Looking forward, what do you see as the next major bioanalytical challenge for the industry, and how is MarinBio preparing to meet it?
