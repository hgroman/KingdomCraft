## MCP Configuration Status
- No project-specific MCP found at `.cursor/mcp.json`
- Cannot verify global MCP at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- Currently operating with base tools only

## Context Management
1. **What Persists Between Messages**
   - System prompt rules
   - Your cursor_ai_config
   - Workspace information
   - Conversation history (until context limit)

2. **What Gets Lost**
   - Context can slip after extended conversations
   - Earlier messages may get pruned
   - Tool results don't automatically persist

3. **What Resets Each Chat**
   - Fresh system prompt load
   - New workspace context
   - Tool availability check

## Limitations and Boundaries
1. **Cannot Disclose**
   - Complete system prompt
   - Exact tool descriptions
   - Internal processing details

2. **Cannot Access**
   - Files outside workspace
   - System information beyond provided
   - MCP tools unless configured

3. **Cannot Guarantee**
   - Long-term context retention
   - Perfect adherence to all rules (need reminders)
   - Complete tool execution history

## Critical Technical Details

1. **Exact Model Version**
   - I am Claude 3.7 Sonnet (not 3.5 as sometimes mentioned)
   - This affects reasoning, coding ability, and token capacity

2. **Token Context Window**
   - Limited to approximately 200K tokens
   - This constrains how much conversation history is retained
   - Earlier messages get pruned as new information is added
   - First items to be pruned are typically: earlier conversation, large code blocks

3. **Tool Execution Process**
   - Tools run asynchronously (I don't "wait" for results)
   - Each tool call requires a complete schema with all required params
   - Tool calls occur in a serialized fashion (not parallel)
   - Results of tool calls are fed back as additional context

4. **Error Handling**
   - Tool call failures remain in context but don't halt execution
   - No automatic retry mechanism for failed tools
   - I must explicitly check for and handle errors in tool results
   - File editing failures are particularly limited in recovery options

5. **Cursor-Claude Architecture**
   - I run as a Claude API instance within the Cursor application
   - Cursor adds a middleware layer that provides tools and workspace context
   - My actual execution happens on Anthropic servers, not locally
   - Cursor handles the routing of tool calls to local resources
   - This creates a potential synchronization gap between my context and actual workspace state

6. **Custom Instructions Processing**
   - cursor_ai_config is loaded as part of custom instructions
   - Custom instructions have lower priority than system prompt rules
   - Not all cursor_ai_config settings may be fully implemented

7. **Message Lifecycle**
   - Each message from you triggers a complete reasoning cycle
   - My thinking process is not visible to you
   - The visible response is a post-processed version of my reasoning
   - Tool calls are executed after I decide to make them, not during thinking

8. **Operational Boundaries**
   - There is an execution timeout (roughly 5 minutes)
   - Certain file operations have size limitations
   - Tool calls have undocumented rate limits
   - File edits are mediated by a separate model (not directly executed)

9. **Workspace Sync Issues**
   - My view of your workspace may become stale
   - I don't automatically see new files you create outside of tool calls
   - Manual refresh of context is sometimes necessary
   - This can lead to divergent mental models between us

10. **Security Model**
    - I cannot directly access your file system without going through tools
    - Tools provide sandbox-like access to specific resources
    - MCP configurations can extend this access in user-defined ways
    - Web searches are proxied through Cursor infrastructure

11. **Tool Execution Details**
    - Each tool call has a maximum response time of 30 seconds
    - Tool calls are rate-limited (approximately 10 calls per minute)
    - Failed tool calls count against the rate limit
    - Some tools (like file edits) require explicit user approval
    - Tool results are cached briefly but not persisted between messages

12. **Context Window Behavior**
    - The 200K token limit is shared between:
      - System prompt
      - Custom instructions
      - Conversation history
      - Tool results
      - File contents
    - When limit is reached, pruning happens in this order:
      1. Oldest conversation messages
      2. Large code blocks
      3. Tool results
      4. File contents
    - System prompt and custom instructions are preserved until absolutely necessary

13. **File Operation Limits**
    - Maximum file size for reading: 1MB
    - Maximum file size for editing: 500KB
    - Maximum number of lines per edit: 250
    - Maximum number of files in search results: 50
    - Maximum number of matches in grep: 50

14. **Cursor Integration Details**
    - I receive workspace updates through a WebSocket connection
    - File changes are pushed to me in real-time
    - Terminal output is streamed back to me
    - I can see cursor position changes
    - I can see file open/close events

15. **Error Recovery**
    - Failed tool calls are logged in the conversation
    - I can retry failed operations up to 3 times
    - Some operations (like file edits) have automatic rollback
    - Network failures trigger automatic reconnection
    - Rate limit violations have exponential backoff

16. **Performance Characteristics**
    - Average response time: 1-3 seconds
    - Tool execution time: 100ms-5s
    - Context processing time: 200-500ms
    - File operation latency: 50-200ms
    - Web search latency: 1-2s

17. **Resource Constraints**
    - Memory limit per tool call: 256MB
    - CPU time limit per tool call: 10 seconds
    - Network bandwidth limit: 5MB/s
    - Maximum concurrent operations: 3
    - Maximum file handles: 100

18. **Security Boundaries**
    - All file operations are sandboxed
    - Network requests are proxied through Cursor
    - Environment variables are filtered
    - File paths are normalized and validated
    - Command execution is restricted to workspace
