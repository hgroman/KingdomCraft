## Market Analysis

### Current Enterprise AI Pain Points
1. **Tool Proliferation Without Orchestration**: Companies have multiple AI tools but no systematic coordination
2. **Context Loss at Scale**: AI projects fail when context spreads too thin across agents/tools
3. **Accountability Vacuum**: No clear audit trail from AI decisions to business outcomes
4. **Ethics Gaps**: No systematic way to ensure AI maintains ethical standards
5. **Value Opacity**: Clients can't understand what they're paying for in AI services

### Market Size & Opportunity
- **Enterprise AI Spending**: $150B+ annually (growing 35% YoY)
- **AI Implementation Failure Rate**: 80% of AI projects fail to deliver expected value
- **Target Market**: Fortune 1000 companies + AI-native startups scaling operations
- **Service Gap**: No established methodology for AI orchestration at enterprise scale
