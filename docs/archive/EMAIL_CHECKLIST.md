# Email Development Checklist

This checklist should be used at each stage of email development to ensure cross-client compatibility and responsive design best practices.

## Initial Setup

- [ ] Started with table-based layout using proper attributes (`role="presentation"`, `cellpadding="0"`, `cellspacing="0"`, `border="0"`)
- [ ] Added viewport meta tag (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`)
- [ ] Set up basic structure with MSO conditional comments for Outlook
- [ ] Created hidden preview text (first 90 characters)
- [ ] Defined base font styles with fallbacks
- [ ] Established max-width container (600px)

## HTML Development

- [ ] All tables include proper attributes (`role="presentation"`, `cellpadding="0"`, `cellspacing="0"`, `border="0"`)
- [ ] All HTML elements have explicit width attributes
- [ ] All images have:
  - [ ] Alt text
  - [ ] Width and height attributes
  - [ ] `display: block` style
  - [ ] `border="0"` if linked
- [ ] All links have:
  - [ ] Tracking parameters if needed
  - [ ] Target attributes
  - [ ] Meaningful text (not "click here")
- [ ] No HTML deprecated elements or attributes
- [ ] All font sizes specified in px (not em, rem, or %)

## CSS Implementation

- [ ] All critical styles are inlined
- [ ] Media queries are properly nested in `<style>` tags
- [ ] All media query styles include `!important` flag
- [ ] Mobile styles account for 600px and 375px breakpoints
- [ ] No CSS shorthand properties for Outlook compatibility
- [ ] No unsupported CSS (flexbox, grid, etc.) without fallbacks
- [ ] Box model properties (margin, padding) applied consistently

## Responsive Design

- [ ] Multiple columns stack on mobile
- [ ] Fonts increase appropriately on mobile
- [ ] Buttons expand to full width on mobile
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44Ã—44px on mobile
- [ ] Padding reduces appropriately on smaller screens
- [ ] Images scale properly with `max-width: 100%`
- [ ] Spacing adjusts appropriately between elements
- [ ] Feature cards are properly centered on mobile devices:
  - [ ] Using `display: block` (not inline-block)
  - [ ] With `margin: 0 auto` AND `text-align: center`
  - [ ] Applying universal selector (`.feature-card *`) for child elements
  - [ ] Removing left/right padding in mobile view
  - [ ] Adding `float: none` for Outlook compatibility

## Outlook-Specific Fixes

- [ ] MSO conditional comments for Outlook-specific styles
- [ ] Table-based layouts for complex structures
- [ ] VML for background images if used
- [ ] Line height specified with `mso-line-height-rule: exactly;`

## Performance
