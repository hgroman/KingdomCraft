# Technical Notes: Dragon Email Template

## Design Decisions

### CSS Architecture
- **CSS Variables**: Used for consistent theming and easier updates
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Implemented with fallbacks for email clients that don't support them
- **Animation Effects**: Added subtle animations with graceful degradation for unsupported clients

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Performance**: Simplified visual effects on mobile to improve rendering performance
- **Simplified Gradients**: Used solid colors as fallbacks on mobile devices
- **Container Sizing**: Applied box-sizing: border-box for more predictable layouts
- **Layout Adjustments**: Changed multi-column layouts to single column on mobile

### Email Client Compatibility
- **Image Handling**: All images have proper alt text and width/height attributes
- **CSS Support**: Critical styles are compatible with major email clients
- **Fallback Strategies**: Gradients fall back to solid colors
- **Table-less Design**: Using div-based layout with appropriate fallbacks

## Implementation Notes

### Animation Implementation
```css
@keyframes shine {
    0% { transform: translateX(0); }
    100% { transform: translateX(200%); }
}
```
- Shine effect uses CSS animations with transform for better performance
- Animation is set to run infinitely but at a slow pace to be subtle
- Mobile devices have animations disabled to improve performance

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **600px**: Main breakpoint for mobile devices
- **375px**: Additional breakpoint for smaller phones
- Media queries use max-width to ensure proper cascading of styles

### Button Implementation
- Buttons use padding and inline-flex for consistent sizing
- Hover effects degrade gracefully in clients that don't support them
- Full width on mobile for better touch targets

## Testing Notes

### Browser Testing
- Tested in: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- Mobile testing: iOS Safari, Chrome for Android

### Email Client Considerations
- Outlook desktop may not support gradients (falls back to solid colors)
- Some animations may not work in all clients (designed to be non-essential)
- Gmail clips emails larger than 102KB (current template is optimized to avoid this)

## Performance Optimizations
- SVG icons converted to PNG for better compatibility
- CSS selectors kept simple to improve rendering performance
- Reduced use of box-shadow and other GPU-intensive properties on mobile
- Minimized hover effects on mobile where they're not needed

## Accessibility Considerations
- Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- All images have descriptive alt text
- Focus states are visible for keyboard navigation
- Text is properly sized for readability on mobile

## Areas for Further Improvement
- Consider using AMP for Email for advanced interactive features
- Implement dark mode support with prefers-color-scheme media query
- Create a more modular template system for easier component reuse
- Add schema markup for better inbox previews
