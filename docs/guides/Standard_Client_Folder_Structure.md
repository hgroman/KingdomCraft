# KingdomCraft Standard Client Folder Structure

## 1. Overview

To ensure consistency, scalability, and maintainability across all client projects, KingdomCraft employs a standardized folder structure within the `/clients/` directory. This structure provides a clear, logical framework for organizing all project-related artifacts, from initial source materials to final deliverables.

Adherence to this structure is managed by the "Keeper of the Estate" persona and is critical for efficient project navigation and for enabling AI-driven analysis and automation tools that rely on predictable data locations.

## 2. Standard Structure

Each new client project under `/clients/[ClientName]/` must adhere to the following top-level directory structure:

```
/clients/[ClientName]/
    ├── 00_source_materials/
    ├── 01_analysis_synthesis/
    ├── 02_planning_strategy/
    ├── 03_deliverables/
    ├── 04_communication/
    ├── 05_admin/
    └── archive/
```

## 3. Directory Descriptions

*   **`00_source_materials/`**
    *   **Purpose:** A repository for all raw, unmodified documents and assets provided by the client or sourced from external research. This is the "single source of truth" for foundational information.
    *   **Examples:** Client brand guidelines, raw data, existing articles, interview transcripts, source code.

*   **`01_analysis_synthesis/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains all files generated by KingdomCraft during the analysis and synthesis phase. This is where we break down source materials and create new insights.
    *   **Examples:** Meta-analysis documents, synthesis reports, content maps, summaries of source materials.

*   **`02_planning_strategy/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Houses all documents related to project planning, strategy, and management.
    *   **Examples:** Work Orders (WOs), strategic plans, content roadmaps, project timelines.

*   **`03_deliverables/`**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains the final, client-facing work products. This folder should represent the polished output of the project.
    *   **Examples:** Final white papers, press release drafts, presentation decks, final reports.

*   **`04_communication/`**
    *   **Purpose:** A log or repository for significant client communications. This helps maintain a record of key decisions and discussions.
    *   **Examples:** Drafts of important emails, summaries of meeting notes, client feedback records.

*   **`05_admin/`**
    *   **Purpose:** For internal administrative files related to the project.
    *   **Examples:** Time logs (`[ClientName]_TimeLog.md`), billing information, internal status notes.

*   **`archive/`**
    *   **Purpose:** A place for old, superseded, or irrelevant files that should be kept for historical purposes but are no longer active in the project.
    *   **Examples:** Outdated drafts, old versions of deliverables, superseded planning documents.

## 4. Rationale & Best Practices

*   **Numbered Prefixes:** Enforce a logical order that loosely follows a typical project lifecycle, from sourcing information to delivering the final product.
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Isolates raw client data from our internal analysis and from the final deliverables, preventing confusion and ensuring data integrity.
*   **AI-Readiness:** A consistent structure allows AI agents and automated scripts to reliably locate and process information, which is essential for advanced features like automated reporting and vector database integration.
*   **Consistency:** All team members and AI personas can navigate any client project with ease, reducing cognitive overhead and improving efficiency.
