Since you have AI pairing in Cursor, leverage it for suggestions, code completion, and explanations as you go through these steps.
Your 30-Day MJML Learning Roadmap (Leveraging Cursor's AI Pairing)
This roadmap focuses on exploring the core MJML features and email design fundamentals highlighted in the sources.
Phase 1: Reinforcing the Basics & Core Components (Days 1-5)
•
Day 1: Revisit Your First Success & Add Text. Open the MJML file for the email you rebuilt. Add a new section and within it, a column. Add a simple text block using <mj-text>. Practice adding some basic text content. Compile/Export to HTML (control shift p -> "mjml export HTML" in a VS Code-like environment) and preview the HTML output.
•
Day 2: Incorporate an Image. Add a new section with a single column. Place an image using the <mj-image> component. Find a placeholder image URL online (or use one from the source brief example) and set the src attribute. Compile and preview.
•
Day 3: Add a Call-to-Action Button. Introduce another section and column. Add a button using the <mj-button> tag. Set the button text and add a placeholder href attribute (e.g., href="#"). Compile and preview.
•
Day 4: Use a Divider. Add a simple divider between two sections using <mj-divider>. Experiment with basic attributes like border-width or border-color if the component supports them (the source mentions changing size, which likely refers to width or thickness). Compile and preview.
•
Day 5: Add Social Icons. Find or create a section for social icons (the sources show them typically in a footer section). Use the <mj-social> component. Add individual <mj-social-element> tags for platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, or Twitter/X. Set basic src for the icons (placeholders are fine) and href attributes. Compile and preview.
Phase 2: Mastering Layout with Sections and Columns (Days 6-10)
•
Day 6: Create a Two-Column Layout. Build a new section and add two <mj-column> tags within it. Put different content (e.g., an image in one, text in the other) in each column. Compile and preview, checking both desktop and mobile views to see how columns stack responsively.
•
Day 7: Control Column Widths. Use the width attribute on your <mj-column> tags in the two-column section. Try setting widths using percentages (e.g., width="50%") or pixels (e.g., width="300px") and observe how the layout changes on desktop.
•
Day 8: Apply Padding for Spacing. Use the padding attribute on sections, columns, and/or content elements (<mj-text>, <mj-image>, etc.). Experiment with shorthand (e.g., padding="10px") and specific side padding (e.g., padding="0 20px"). Compile and preview to see how spacing is added inside the element's border.
•
Day 9: Understand Margin and Border. While sources focus heavily on padding, understand the concepts of margin (space outside the border) and border (a frame around the element) as explained in the sources. Add a border attribute to a section or column to see its effect visually.
•
Day 10: Create More Complex Column Layouts. Try creating a section with three columns. Place different content in each. See how they stack on mobile. Or create sections with alternating single and multiple columns to build a more complex structure.
Phase 3: Advanced Styling & The Head (Days 11-15)
•
Day 11: Style Text Appearance. Go back to your text elements (<mj-text>) and apply styling attributes like font-size, color, font-weight, and line-height. Compile and preview.
•
Day 12: Style Buttons Further. Enhance your button designs using attributes like background-color, color (for text color), and border-radius for rounded corners. Compile and preview.
•
Day 13: Introduce the <mj-head> Section. Add the <mj-head> tag at the top of your MJML document, just below <mjml>. Inside the head, add an <mj-attributes> tag. Learn how to set default styles for components using nested tags like <mj-all>, <mj-text>, etc..
•
Day 14: Add a Custom Font. Use the <mj-font> tag within <mj-head> to include a custom web font (like Montserrat from the source example). You'll need the font URL. Then, update the font-family in your <mj-attributes> (e.g., targeting <mj-all>) to use your custom font, followed by fallback fonts like Arial and sans-serif. Compile and preview (note: font rendering can vary by client).
•
Day 15: Manage Default Styles in Head. Use <mj-attributes> to set default font-size, line-height, and font-weight for your text elements across the email. See how these defaults are applied, and how you can override them on individual component tags in the body.
Phase 4: Email Design Fundamentals (Days 16-20)
•
Day 16: Focus on Image Accessibility (Alt Text). Go through your email and ensure every <mj-image> has a descriptive alt attribute. Understand why alt text is important (screen readers, images blocked by clients).
•
Day 17: Ensure Color Contrast. Review the colors used for text and backgrounds. While sources mention using a tool, manually check for sufficient contrast to improve readability, especially for users with visual impairments.
•
Day 18: Make Link Text Meaningful. Look at any links you've added (buttons, text links). Ensure the link text is descriptive of the destination, rather than generic like "click here".
•
Day 19: Set the HTML Language. Add the lang="en" attribute directly to the opening <mjml> tag. Understand that this is a standard HTML practice that aids accessibility.
•
Day 20: Review Image Best Practices. Recall the sources' advice about images: don't rely too heavily on images for critical information (as they can be blocked). If considering dark mode, be mindful of how images render (e.g., using transparent PNGs).
Phase 5: Testing & Client Compatibility (Days 21-25)
•
Day 21: Examine the Generated HTML. Compile your most complex email to HTML. Open the generated .html file and scroll through it. Observe the complex nested tables and inline CSS that MJML creates. Appreciate the complexity you avoided by using MJML.
•
Day 22: Perform a Real-World Test (Putsmail). Copy the generated HTML. Use a testing service like putsmail.com (recommended in sources) to send the email to your personal email address.
•
Day 23: Test on Multiple Clients/Devices. Open the test email you sent via putsmail on different email clients and devices you use (e.g., desktop Gmail, mobile Apple Mail). Note how the email looks on each – pay attention to layout, spacing, and how fonts render.
•
Day 24: Test Dark Mode. On a device that supports dark mode (like an iPhone or Mac), enable dark mode in your email client settings. View the test email again. Observe how colors might invert or change, especially backgrounds and text.
•
Day 25: Implement a Simple Dark Mode Hack (Apple Mail). Learn about using the <mj-raw> tag to include raw HTML/CSS in the <mj-head>. Implement the simple meta tag hack shown in the sources to potentially force light mode specifically in Apple Mail clients. Test again using putsmail and check in Apple Mail dark mode. (Note: Dark mode handling is complex and this is a basic hack, as the sources explain).
Phase 6: Practice, Refinement & Real-World Touches (Days 26-30)
•
Day 26: Add Preview Text and Title. Include the <mj-preview> and <mj-title> tags within your <mj-head> section. Add compelling text for both. Compile and test via putsmail to see how they appear in the inbox before opening the email.
•
Day 27: Include Required Footer Elements. Add a footer section (if you don't have one). Include placeholders for an unsubscribe link (<a href="#">Unsubscribe</a> styled appropriately, noting a real link is needed for actual sends) and a physical mailing address. These are legal requirements in some places (like under CAN-SPAM in the US).
•
Day 28: Build from a Simple Brief (Part 1: Structure). Imagine you receive a design brief like the one described in the sources. Outline the main sections required (header, hero, content block, footer, etc.). Create the basic MJML structure using <mjml>, <mj-body>, <mj-section>, and <mj-column> tags based on the brief's layout requirements.
•
Day 29: Build from a Simple Brief (Part 2: Content & Basic Styling). Add the required content elements (text, images, buttons) into the columns and sections created on Day 28. Apply basic styling based on the brief's style guide (colors, font sizes, button styles, max-width for the body).
•
Day 30: Build from a Simple Brief (Part 3: Refinement & Testing). Add accessibility features (alt text, lang attribute). Add preview text/title. Review the email against the brief and check responsiveness in Cursor's preview (if available) or by compiling and viewing the HTML. Conduct a final test using putsmail and check on different clients, simulating the brief's required compatibility (e.g., Apple Mail, Gmail).
By following this roadmap, you'll systematically explore the core components, layout techniques, styling methods, and critical email design considerations like accessibility and testing, all directly supported by the knowledge in the sources. Your AI pairing in Cursor can act as your co-pilot, assisting with syntax, attribute suggestions, and potentially even generating code snippets for these daily tasks, making the process even smoother! Good luck!
