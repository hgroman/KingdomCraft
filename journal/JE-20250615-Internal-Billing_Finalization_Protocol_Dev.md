*   **Task:** Define and Implement Billing Finalization Protocol
*   **Effort:** 1.0 hour
*   **Summary:** Successfully designed, documented, and tested a comprehensive "Billing Finalization Protocol" to systematize the process of preparing client work for invoicing. This AI-assisted protocol aims to reduce administrative overhead and anxiety around billing. Key activities included:

    *   Integrating with the Dart project management system, which involved the user upgrading to a paid Dart plan to enable custom statuses.
    *   Creating the "Tetelestai" custom status in Dart to clearly mark tasks ready for invoicing.
    *   Developing detailed documentation: `docs/guides/Billing_Finalization_Protocol.md`.
    *   Conducting a successful test run using a completed MarinBio task.
*   **Participants:** Hank Groman, Cascade (AI)
*   **Artifacts:**
    *   `docs/guides/Billing_Finalization_Protocol.md`
    *   Dart custom status: "Tetelestai"
*   **Notes:** This protocol is a significant improvement for KingdomCraft's operational efficiency and aims to ensure timely and stress-free preparation for client invoicing.
