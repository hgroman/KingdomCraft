**Participants:** Hank Groman, AI Assistant (MJML Component Architect Persona)
**Summary:**
This session focused on establishing a new IDE-native project management system, refining documentation, and outlining a strategic shift towards a multi-persona AI workflow to support an MJML-first approach for the EmailForge project.

Key activities and decisions included:

1.  **New Project Management Structure Implemented:**
    *   Created `journal/` directory for chronological logging.
    *   Created `journal_index.yml` for structured indexing of journal entries.
    *   Created `tasks.yml` for task management.
    *   Created `work_orders/` directory for delegable, detailed task specifications.
    *   Created `persona_prompts/` directory to store AI persona definitions.
2.  **Main `README.md` Overhauled:**
    *   Updated to be the central authoritative guide for the project.
    *   Incorporated an "AI Onboarding & Context Anchoring Protocol."
    *   Added "Project Management & Workflow" and "Standard Workflow for New Initiatives" sections.
    *   Revised "Project Structure" to reflect the new management files/directories and current project layout.
    *   Corrected link to MasterDocumentation.md.
3.  **Strategic Shift to Multi-Persona AI Workflow:**
    *   Discussed and agreed to move towards a workflow utilizing distinct AI personas (e.g., Content Strategist, MJML Developer, MJML Component Architect) for different focused efforts.
    *   This approach aims to leverage specialized AI capabilities for each stage of the email creation process.
    *   The `persona_prompts/` directory will house the definitions for these roles.
    *   **Action Item:** The main `README.md` should be updated to briefly introduce this multi-persona concept as part of the project's operational strategy.
4.  **MJML Component Architect Persona Defined:**
    *   Identified the need for this foundational role.
    *   Created `persona_prompts/mjml_component_architect_persona.md` to define the AI's responsibilities in this capacity.
5.  **Work Order for Component Identification Created:**
    *   Drafted `work_orders/WO_Initial_MJML_Component_Identification.md` to delegate the task of analyzing the pilot MJML template for initial reusable components, suitable for a specialized AI persona.
6.  **Documentation Housekeeping:**
    *   Updated `docs/guides/MasterDocumentation.md` to:
        *   Defer to the main `README.md` for primary operational guidance.
        *   Clearly demarcate legacy content and links.
        *   Align its system overview and workflow descriptions with the current MJML focus.
7.  **Legacy Content Handling Strategy:**
    *   Discussed and agreed on a strategy for managing legacy files: mark as historical, consolidate into archive directories with explanatory READMEs, and eventually remove from the active project when obsolete.

**Next Steps:**
*   User to move old Work Order files into the new `work_orders/` directory. (Completed by User)
*   AI to create explanatory READMEs for `docs/legacy/` and `docs/archive/`. (Current next action)
*   AI to update main `README.md` to include a note about the multi-persona AI workflow. (New action item from this discussion)
*   User to delegate `WO_Initial_MJML_Component_Identification.md` to another AI.
*   Architect AI to await results and then proceed with component library creation.
