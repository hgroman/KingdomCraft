### Summary of Work Performed

This journal entry documents the discussion, creation, and refinement of the "Standard Work Order Process" guide for the Voice Automated Email Template System project. This work was undertaken to formalize and improve the project's workflow, ensuring clarity, traceability, and consistent documentation.

**1. Identification of Need:**
Following the completion of `TASK001` (initial MJML component creation), a need was identified to create a more explicit and robust process for managing units of work, centered around a formalized "Work Order" concept. The goal was to strengthen the "popcorn trail" between tasks, journal entries, handoffs, and the work itself.

**2. Creation of `docs/guides/Work_Order_Process.md`:**
*   A new guide, `docs/guides/Work_Order_Process.md`, was drafted and created.
*   **Key elements defined in this guide include:**
    *   Purpose and overview of Work Orders (WOs).
    *   Roles of different project personas (Initiator, Executor, Reviewer) in the WO lifecycle.
    *   Detailed WO Lifecycle stages:
        *   Initiation: Including triggers, responsibilities, filename conventions (`WO<ID>_*.md`), and explicit ID generation rules for WOs (incrementing from the highest existing WO ID) and their related Tasks (incrementing from the highest existing Task ID).
        *   Assignment.
        *   Execution.
        *   **Mandatory Completion Protocol:** Detailing the required steps to close a WO, including creation of a journal entry, updating `tasks.yml`, creating a handoff document (all cross-referencing the WO ID), and optional WO archival.
    *   **Mandatory WO Document Contents:** A template specifying required fields for every WO document, with a prioritized order to provide quick context (e.g., `WO ID`, `Status`, `Related Task ID`, `Input Documents` listed prominently).
    *   Integration points with `tasks.yml`, `journal/`, and `Handoff/` documents.
    *   Emphasis on process adherence.

**3. Update to `README.md`:**
*   The main `README.md` file was updated to:
    *   Include the new `work_orders/` directory (with `active/` and `completed/` subdirectories) in the "Project Structure" section.
    *   Add a direct link to the new `docs/guides/Work_Order_Process.md` within the "Project Management & Workflow" section, under "Core Components".

**4. Rationale for this Process Improvement:**
*   To enhance clarity and consistency in managing project work.
*   To improve traceability of work from initiation to completion.
*   To streamline collaboration between human and AI team members by providing a clear, documented process.
*   To ensure all critical project management artifacts (tasks, journals, handoffs) are consistently created and linked.

This new process guide is intended to be a living document, subject to review and refinement by the MJML Component Architect and other stakeholders.
