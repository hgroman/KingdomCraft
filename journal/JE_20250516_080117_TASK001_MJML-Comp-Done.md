summary: >
  Completed all tasks for Work Order WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md.
  This involved creating and documenting 13 MJML components based on the
  mjml_component_analysis_report.md. Addressed and rectified discrepancies
  from previous AI's work, including missing files and incorrectly located
  documentation. The `docs/mjml_component_docs/` directory, an artifact of
  previous work, has been fully cleaned up and removed. All components
  are now in their designated `templates/components/{category}/` and
  `docs/components/{category}/` locations.

## Work Performed:

1.  **Resumed and Completed Handoff Document Tasks:**
    *   Followed `Handoff/2025-05-15_204320_WO-COMP-CREATE-001_InProgress.md`.
    *   Corrected file locations and content for `va-text-intro` and `va-callout-highlight` components and their documentation.
    *   Verified deletion of specified legacy directories (which were already removed).

2.  **Systematic Component Creation & Documentation (Components 1-13):**
    *   Iterated through components listed in `work_orders/completed/mjml_component_analysis_report.md`.
    *   For each component:
        *   Created the `.mjml` file in the appropriate `templates/components/{category}/` directory.
        *   Ensured its corresponding `.md` documentation file was created/moved to the correct `docs/components/{category}/` directory with accurate content (including `Location` and MJML code snippets).
    *   Cleaned up the `docs/mjml_component_docs/` directory structure by moving valid documentation to the correct project paths and removing the now-empty `docs/mjml_component_docs/` and its subdirectories.

## Created/Validated Component and Documentation Files:
