**Date:** 2025-05-17
**Time:** 10:00:00
**Participants:** User, Legacy System Analyst & Documenter (AI)
**Work Order ID:** WO_Legacy_System_Doc_001

## Summary of Work Done:

This journal entry details the completion of Work Order WO_Legacy_System_Doc_001, which tasked the "Legacy System Analyst & Documenter" persona with analyzing and documenting the legacy (non-MJML) email template system.

Key activities performed include:
1.  Reviewed the original legacy `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.
2.  Analyzed the structure and components of the legacy email assets.
3.  Collaborated with the user on organizing the legacy assets into the `Archive-Legacy/` directory, specifically into `Archive-Legacy/Legacy-templates/` (for core templates/components) and `Archive-Legacy/Legacy-HTML-Creations/` (for other HTML examples/files).
4.  Created and refined the primary documentation file for the legacy system.
5.  Addressed and clarified the roles of multiple documentation files, ensuring a clear primary guide.
6.  Identified and separated potentially non-legacy documents from the main `docs/` directory into a review folder as per user direction.

## Deliverables:

*   The primary deliverable, a comprehensive guide to the legacy email system, has been created and finalized by the user at the following location:
    *   **`Archive-Legacy/Legacy-README.md`**
*   The original implementation guide for the legacy system is preserved at:
    *   **`Archive-Legacy/Legacy_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`**
*   Legacy template/component assets are organized under:
    *   **`Archive-Legacy/Legacy-templates/`**
*   Other related legacy HTML files are organized under:
    *   **`Archive-Legacy/Legacy-HTML-Creations/`**

## Notes:

*   The documentation clearly states that the legacy system is archived and superseded by the current MJML-based workflow.
*   The process involved several iterations of file organization and documentation refinement based on user feedback and direct actions.
*   The `legacy_system_analyst_documenter.md` persona prompt was the initial guide, with this formal Work Order (`WO_Legacy_System_Doc_001`) providing more specific procedural close-out requirements.

This Work Order is now considered complete as per the defined objectives and deliverables, with the final documentation reflecting the user's preferred structure and clarity.
