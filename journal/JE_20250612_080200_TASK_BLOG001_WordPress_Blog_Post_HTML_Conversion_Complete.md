## Summary:
Successfully converted the provided Markdown blog post ("Revolutionary Advancement: DAX Copilot Introduces Specialty-Specific AI Models") into a self-contained HTML file suitable for a WordPress Elementor widget. This involved:
1.  Creating a Work Order (`WO_TASK_BLOG001_20250611_Blog-Post-DAX-Copilot-HTML.md`).
2.  Identifying and applying Voice Automated color schemes and styles by referencing `work_orders/active/Recent Voice Auto Page for Style Guide.html`.
3.  Generating an HTML file (`work_orders/active/dax_copilot_blog_post.html`) with scoped CSS.
4.  Iteratively refining the HTML to remove a redundant hero section, ensuring better integration with the WordPress theme's handling of post titles and featured images.
5.  Providing SEO-optimized recommendations for the hero image (filename, alt text, title, description).

## Process:
1.  Received Markdown content and request for HTML conversion with Voice Automated branding.
2.  Initiated Work Order `WO_TASK_BLOG001`.
3.  USER provided `Recent Voice Auto Page for Style Guide.html` as the style reference.
4.  Analyzed style guide and converted Markdown to HTML, embedding scoped CSS.
5.  Addressed USER feedback regarding a duplicate hero section by removing it from the generated HTML.
6.  Provided SEO metadata recommendations for the hero image.
7.  USER confirmed application of the HTML, further image revisions based on client feedback, and publication of the blog post.

## Outcome:
*   The HTML for the blog post was successfully generated and delivered.
*   The USER was able to integrate this HTML into their WordPress site.
*   The task `TASK_BLOG001` is now considered complete from the AI's deliverable perspective.

## Learnings & Notes:
*   Initial persona scan for existing assets (like style guides) needs to be more thorough, especially within active work directories. This was a key learning for the Project Governor persona.
*   Clarifying how generated HTML will integrate with the target platform (e.g., WordPress theme handling of titles/featured images) upfront can prevent rework.

## Next Steps:
*   Update `tasks.yml` for `TASK_BLOG001` to "done".
*   Create Handoff document for `TASK_BLOG001`.
*   Archive Work Order `WO_TASK_BLOG001`.
