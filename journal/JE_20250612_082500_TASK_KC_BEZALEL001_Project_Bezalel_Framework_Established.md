## Summary:
Successfully established the "KingdomCraft - Project Bezalel" framework (The Bezalel Framework) for effort and value quantification within the KingdomCraft project. This strategic initiative codifies the project's value-centric mindset and creates a formal process for continuous improvement and meta-analysis.

## Process:
1.  Following the successful real-world test of the KingdomCraft Steward persona (`TASK_BLOG001`), the USER initiated a strategic pivot to formalize the project's philosophy on value and effort.
2.  A new Work Order (`WO_TASK_KC_BEZALEL001_20250612_Project-Bezalel-Framework.md`) was created to scope and track this initiative.
3.  The foundational `docs/guides/Effort_And_Value_Philosophy.md` document was created to define the principle of "Value Amplification Over Time Savings."
4.  The KingdomCraft Steward persona (`persona_prompts/1. emailforge_project_governor_persona.md`) was updated to require a review of this philosophy during its initialization sequence, embedding the principle into its core logic.
5.  A new `meta_analysis/` directory was created to house process improvement artifacts.
6.  The first meta-analysis report (`MA_20250612_Project-Bezalel-Framework-Analysis.md`) was created, analyzing the session's evolution and capturing key learnings.

## Outcome:
*   All deliverables for `TASK_META001` have been met.
*   The EmailForge project now has a formal, documented framework for quantifying value and driving process improvement.
*   The KingdomCraft Steward persona is now aligned with this new strategic framework.

## Next Steps:
*   Update `tasks.yml` for `TASK_KC_BEZALEL001` to "done".
*   Create Handoff document for `TASK_KC_BEZALEL001`.
*   Archive Work Order `WO_TASK_KC_BEZALEL001`.
