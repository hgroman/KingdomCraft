## 1. Summary

This journal entry marks two significant milestones:
1.  The successful completion of the comprehensive rebranding of the project from "EmailForge" to "KingdomCraft." All primary documentation, code artifacts, persona prompts, and internal references have been updated to reflect the new "KingdomCraft" name, the "KingdomCraft Steward" persona, and The Bezalel Framework philosophy.
2.  A strategic pivot to onboard a new client, MarinBio. This initiative will involve the creation of a new specialized "Client Steward" persona for MarinBio, focused on deep knowledge assimilation and strategic partnership.

## 2. KingdomCraft Rebrand Completion (TASK_KC_REBRAND_FINALIZE)

*   **Objective:** To perform a final project-wide sweep for any remaining legacy "EmailForge" references in documentation, scripts, or artifacts, and to update them to "KingdomCraft," thereby finalizing the rebrand.
*   **Work Performed:**
    *   Conducted a `grep_search` for "EmailForge" across the entire project directory.
    *   Systematically reviewed and updated all identified instances in critical project files, including:
        *   `README.md`
        *   `docs/Tools.md`
        *   `package-lock.json`
        *   `docs/guides/KingdomCraft_Effort_And_Value_Philosophy_The_Bezalel_Framework.md`
        *   Archived Work Order: `work_orders/Archive/WO_TASK_KC_BEZALEL001_20250612_Project-Bezalel-Framework.md`
        *   Archived Handoff: `Handoff/HO_20250612_082600_TASK_BEZALEL001_Project_Bezalel_Framework_Complete.md`
        *   Meta-Analysis Document: `meta_analysis/MA_TASK_KC_BEZALEL001_20250612_Project-Bezalel-Framework-Analysis.md`
    *   Confirmed that chat logs, internal notes, and already archived legacy files were intentionally left unchanged to preserve historical accuracy.
*   **Outcome:** The KingdomCraft rebrand is now complete. The project is fully aligned with the new branding and ready for subsequent development phases.

## 3. Strategic Pivot to MarinBio Client Onboarding (TASK_MARINBIO_ONBOARD_INIT)

*   **Context:** Following the successful rebrand, a strategic decision was made to prioritize the onboarding of a new client, MarinBio. This initiative serves as a practical application and extension of the KingdomCraft framework.
*   **Objective:** To initiate the MarinBio client engagement by:
    1.  Defining and creating a new "MarinBio Client Steward" persona.
    2.  Beginning the process of comprehensive information gathering about MarinBio (identity, brand, history, assets, messaging, etc.).
    3.  Laying the groundwork for developing a 6-month white paper plan and a subsequent press release.
*   **Next Steps (Immediate):**
    1.  Create a Handoff document to summarize the current state of KingdomCraft internal development and detail this pivot.
    2.  Define the "MarinBio Client Steward" persona.
    3.  Create the persona prompt file (`persona_prompts/3.marinbio_client_steward_persona.md`).
    4.  Update `tasks.yml` with the new MarinBio initiative.
    5.  Create a Work Order for the MarinBio onboarding and initial strategic planning.

## 4. Reflections & Learnings

This pivot represents a natural evolution of the KingdomCraft project, demonstrating its adaptability. The process of rebranding has reinforced the importance of meticulous attention to detail and consistent application of project conventions. The upcoming MarinBio engagement will provide valuable opportunities to refine the multi-persona AI collaboration model in a client-facing context.
