# Journal Entry

**Date:** 2025-06-16
**Timestamp (UTC):** 20250616_222919
**Associated Task ID:** `TASK_PKA_WRAPUP_001`
**Subject:** Journal Entry for Persona Knowledge Architecture Refinement and Handoff Creation

## 1. Summary of Activities & Accomplishments:

*   **Client Onboarding Framework:**
    *   Successfully refined `docs/guides/Client_Onboarding_Protocol.md` (to v1.1), incorporating detailed procedures for transcript collection and clarifying the roles of Client Stewards and SME sub-personas in analyzing client data.
    *   Created the `personas/client_onboarding_specialist_persona.md`, defining its role in executing the onboarding protocol.
*   **File System & Persona Management (Corrective Actions & Standardization):**
    *   Relocated the `3.marinbio_client_steward_persona.md` to its correct, user-specified path within the client's directory: `clients/MarinBio/3.marinbio_client_steward_persona.md`.
    *   Systematically removed incorrectly created directories (`personas/clients/MarinBio/`, `personas/clients/`) and the original persona file from `personas/`.
*   **Documentation Integrity:**
    *   Updated the knowledge manifest `personas/manifests/1.kingdomcraft_steward.md` to accurately reflect the new path for the MarinBio Client Steward persona.
    *   Conducted a review of other manifest files and `docs/guides/Multi-LLM_Interaction_Model.md`, confirming no further path modifications were required for this specific file move.
*   **Process Adherence & Learning:**
    *   Acknowledged and integrated critical user feedback regarding directory creation protocols (explicit approval now required).
    *   Clarified and corrected previous misunderstandings regarding the definition status of Client Profile structures.
*   **Session Handoff:**
    *   Generated a comprehensive Handoff document (`HO_20250616_222919_TASK_PKA_WRAPUP_001_PKA_Refinement_NextSteps_BootUpModel.md`) detailing all work completed, the current project state, and clearly outlining outstanding tasks, primarily the enhancement of `docs/guides/Multi-LLM_Interaction_Model.md`.

## 2. Key Outcomes & Decisions:

*   The client onboarding process is now more robustly defined.
*   MarinBio persona file is correctly located.
*   Critical AI operational directive (no unauthorized directory creation) is in place.
*   A clear plan for enhancing the multi-LLM interaction model is ready for the next session.

## 3. Next Steps (Identified in Handoff):

*   Focus on strategically defining and documenting the enhanced persona boot-up sequence in `docs/guides/Multi-LLM_Interaction_Model.md`.
*   Address client context determination, client-specific knowledge loading, SME sub-persona orchestration, and the integration of the `Client Onboarding Specialist Persona` into the boot-up model.

This Journal Entry documents the significant progress made in refining the persona knowledge architecture and sets the stage for the next phase of work.
