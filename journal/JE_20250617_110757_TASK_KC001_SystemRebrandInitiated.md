## Journal Entry: TASK_KC001 - System Rebrand Initiated

**Task ID:** TASK_KC001
**Work Order Created:** `work_orders/active/WO_TASK_KC001_20250617_SystemRebrand.md`

**Details:**

This journal entry marks the formal initiation and documentation alignment for `TASK_KC001 - System Rebrand: KingdomCraft Setup & Configuration`.

Observations during a routine project health check revealed that this critical task, despite being active and due shortly (2025-06-19), was missing key project management artifacts:
*   No linked Work Order in `tasks.yml`.
*   No `latest_journal_entry` specified in `tasks.yml`.

To rectify this and ensure adherence to the established Work Order process, the following actions were taken:
1.  A new Work Order, `WO_TASK_KC001_20250617_SystemRebrand.md`, was created in the `work_orders/active/` directory. This WO details the objectives, scope, deliverables, and acceptance criteria for the comprehensive rebranding effort.
2.  The `tasks.yml` file was updated to include a `related_work_order_id` field for `TASK_KC001`, linking it to the newly created WO.

This JE serves as the initial log for this task. Future progress, milestones, and completion will be documented in subsequent journal entries.

**Next Steps for TASK_KC001:**
*   Begin execution of the tasks outlined in `WO_TASK_KC001_20250617_SystemRebrand.md`.
*   Regularly update with Journal Entries to log progress.
