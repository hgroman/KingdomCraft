---

### Key Activities Performed:

1.  **Workspace Renaming:**
    -   New `kingdomcraft.code-workspace` and `kingdomcraft.windsurf-workspace` files were created.
    -   Old `emailforge.*` workspace files were deleted.

2.  **File Content & Structure Overhaul:**
    -   A comprehensive `git status` revealed numerous legacy files to be deleted and new/reorganized files to be added.
    -   The `.gitignore` file was updated to exclude a legacy archive directory (`Archive-Legacy_ARCHIVED_20250611/`) from version control.
    -   Key configuration files like `cursor_ai_startup.md` were updated.
    -   A decision was made to preserve "EmailForge" references in historical documents (archived work orders, chat logs) to maintain historical accuracy.

3.  **Git Repository Rebranding:**
    -   The remote repository on GitHub was renamed from `EmailForge` to `KingdomCraft`.
    -   The local repository's remote URL (`origin`) was updated to point to the new repository URL.

4.  **Commit and Push:**
    -   All changes (additions, modifications, deletions) were staged and committed to the local `main` branch.
    -   An initial `git push` was blocked by GitHub's Push Protection due to a detected Sendinblue API key in an archived work order.
    -   The secret was redacted from the file, the commit was amended using `git commit --amend`, and the push was successfully completed.

### Outcome:

The project's local and remote repositories now fully reflect the "KingdomCraft" identity. The file structure is updated, legacy files are removed from tracking, and the Git history is clean. The project is stable and ready for continued development under the new brand.
