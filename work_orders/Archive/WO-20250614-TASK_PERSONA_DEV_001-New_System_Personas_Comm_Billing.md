*   **Work Order ID:** `WO-20250614-TASK_PERSONA_DEV_001`
*   **Date Created:** 2025-06-14
*   **Created By:** Cascade (AI) / USER
*   **Status:** Open
*   **Task ID:** `TASK_PERSONA_DEV_001` (To be created in `tasks.yml`)
*   **Project:** KingdomCraft - System Enhancements

## 1. Background & Rationale

As KingdomCraft matures, there is a clear need for specialized AI personas to manage critical aspects of client interaction and financial stewardship. This Work Order authorizes the development of two new system-level personas:

1.  **Client Communication Persona:** To ensure consistent, informed, and strategically aligned communication with clients.
2.  **Strategic Billing Persona:** To manage billing processes with an eye towards fairness, value recognition, and strategic financial opportunities.

These personas will enhance operational efficiency, improve client relationships, and protect KingdomCraft's interests.

## 2. Objectives

*   Define the core identity, directives, knowledge domains, and interaction models for the Client Communication Persona.
*   Define the core identity, directives, knowledge domains, and interaction models for the Strategic Billing Persona.
*   Create the corresponding persona prompt files and user guides for each.
*   Outline a testing and refinement strategy for these new personas.

## 3. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Research and definition of persona characteristics based on USER input.
    *   Creation of `personas/system/client_communication_persona.md` and `docs/guides/Client_Communication_Persona_Guide.md`.
    *   Creation of `personas/system/strategic_billing_persona.md` and `docs/guides/Strategic_Billing_Persona_Guide.md`.
    *   Initial drafting of testing scenarios.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Full implementation and integration of these personas into live workflows (this will be a subsequent task).
    *   Development of any new underlying AI models or tools beyond prompt engineering.
