Okay, I understand. The core issue is that the **MJML components ended up in the wrong places** due to conflicting instructions, causing confusion and frustrating the project flow. This Work Order needs to cut directly to that problem and fix it according to our established process.

Based on our discussions and the documentation, the definitive location for MJML source components should be `src/mjml-source/components/`. We also need to make sure the `README.md` explicitly states this as the authoritative source of truth.

Here is the new Work Order, drafted to be comprehensive, use full paths, and address the problem directly, following the structure defined in `docs/guides/Work_Order_Process.md`:

```markdown
# Work Order: WO002

## Title: **RECTIFY MJML COMPONENT LOCATION TO SRC/MJML-SOURCE/ & UPDATE DOCUMENTATION**

## Status: Open

## Related Task ID in tasks.yml: TASK003

## Input Documents/Prerequisites:
*   **README.md**: Primary project guide, requires update to reflect correct path.
*   **docs/guides/Work_Order_Process.md**: Authoritative source for WO execution and completion protocol.
*   **work_orders/completed/WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md**: The completed Work Order whose flawed instructions led to incorrect placement.
*   **work_orders/completed/mjml_component_analysis_report.md**: Lists the 13 core components to be relocated.
*   **Handoff/2025-05-15_204320_WO-COMP-CREATE-001_InProgress.md**: Shows the initial attempts at component creation and cleanup.
*   **Handoff/2025-05-16_150102_WO-COMP-CREATE-001_Completed.md**: Reports completion of the initial creation WO, stating components were placed in `templates/components/`.
*   **Journal Entries linked to TASK001/WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md**: Specifically journal/2025-05-16_150102_WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Completed.md and journal/2025-05-15_205938_Completed-WO-MJML-Component-Initial-Doc.md, which document the placement in `templates/components/`.
*   **Current file system state**: Especially the contents of `templates/components/`, `src/mjml_components/`, and potentially `templates/mjml-source/components/`, and the component documentation files (likely in `docs/components/` based on `WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md`).

## Date Created: (AI to populate current date YYYY-MM-DD)

## Created By Persona: Hank Groman (as MJML Component Architect)

## Assigned Persona(s): AI Assistant (acting as File Structure Rectifier / Project Archivist)

## Priority: **CRITICAL / URGENT**

## Due Date: Immediate

## Objective/Goal:
**To definitively establish** `src/mjml-source/components/` **as the single, authoritative location for all core MJML component source files, update** `README.md` **to reflect this, move all 13 core components and their corresponding documentation to their correct locations, and clean up incorrect/legacy directories and documentation references.**

## Background/Context:
The initial Work Order for MJML component creation (`work_orders/completed/WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md`, TASK001) incorrectly instructed the executing AI to place component files in `templates/components/`. This instruction contradicted the implication of `README.md` regarding MJML source file locations (`templates/mjml-source/`). Furthermore, files also appeared in `src/mjml_components/` due to undocumented actions. This inconsistency has caused significant confusion, wasted effort, and broken trust in the project structure and process. This Work Order directly addresses these fundamental issues by:
1. Explicitly defining `src/mjml-source/components/` as the correct location for component source files.
2. Updating the project's primary guide (`README.md`) to document this.
3. Moving the components from their current incorrect locations (`templates/components/`, `src/mjml_components/`) to the newly confirmed location.
4. Relocating and updating the component documentation to mirror the new source structure.
5. Cleaning up the old, incorrect directories.

## Scope of Work / Detailed Tasks:

1.  **Define & Document Correct Structure:**
    *   Explicitly confirm `src/mjml-source/components/` is the target directory for MJML component source files.
    *   Explicitly confirm `docs/mjml-source/components/` is the target directory for corresponding MJML component documentation files.
    *   Update **`README.md`** in the "Project Structure" section to accurately reflect the `src/mjml-source/components/` and `docs/mjml-source/components/` paths. Add or clarify text stating that these are the authoritative locations for MJML components and their documentation.
2.  **Identify Target Components:** Confirm the list of 13 core MJML components based on `work_orders/completed/mjml_component_analysis_report.md`.
3.  **Locate Component Files & Documentation:** Search for these 13 component `.mjml` files and their corresponding `.md` documentation files within the following likely directories:
    *   `templates/components/`
    *   `src/mjml_components/`
    *   `docs/components/`
    *   (Also check `src/mjml-source/components/` and `docs/mjml-source/components/` in case any were already placed there).
4.  **Move Component Source Files:** For each of the 13 identified component `.mjml` files, move the file and its correct subdirectory structure (e.g., `structure/`, `content/`, `common/` as per the analysis report) to the correct location: **`src/mjml-source/components/`**.
    *   Ensure that if a component `.mjml` file exists in multiple incorrect locations, the most complete or correct version is moved (if ambiguity exists, flag for review).
5.  **Move & Update Component Documentation Files:** For each of the 13 identified component `.md` documentation files, move the file to the correct location: **`docs/mjml-source/components/`**.
    *   Update the `Location:` field within each moved `.md` file to accurately point to the *new* source file path (e.g., `src/mjml-source/components/{category}/component-name.mjml`).
    *   Review and update any other internal path references within these documentation files to reflect the new structure.
6.  **Clean Up Incorrect Source Directories:**
    *   After moving files, verify if `templates/components/` is empty or contains only moved files. If so, delete the `templates/components/` directory.
    *   Verify if `src/mjml_components/` is empty or contains only duplicates of the 13 core components that have now been moved. If so, delete the `src/mjml_components/` directory. If it contains other files, flag them for review before deleting the directory.
    *   Verify if `docs/components/` is empty or contains only moved documentation files. If so, delete the `docs/components/` directory. If it contains other files, flag them for review before deleting the directory.
7.  **Update Active Documentation Paths:** Review active process documents (e.g., `docs/guides/Work_Order_Process.md`, `docs/guides/MasterDocumentation.md`, persona prompts, or any new guides) that might contain hardcoded references to `templates/components/`, `src/mjml_components/`, or `docs/components/` when referring to the *current* location of the 13 core components or their documentation. Update any such incorrect paths found to the correct **`src/mjml-source/components/`** and **`docs/mjml-source/components/`** respectively.
    *   **DO NOT** edit historical documents such as completed Work Orders, journal entries, or handoff documents related to TASK001/WO_MJML_Component_Creation_Initial_Doc.md; they are historical records of the flawed process.
8.  **Follow Standard Completion Protocol:** Execute the mandatory steps defined in `docs/guides/Work_Order_Process.md` Section 4.4:
    *   Create a detailed **Journal Entry** documenting the completion of this Work Order (Ref. WO002, files moved, directories affected, docs updated). Ensure this is the *final* journal entry, not a draft, as per our refined process.
    *   Update the corresponding task in **`tasks.yml`** (TASK003) to 'done' (or 'review', if review is needed). Reference WO002 and the Journal Entry filename in the task entry.
    *   Create a **Handoff Document** summarizing the completion (Ref. WO002 and Journal Entry).
    *   Archive this Work Order document (`WO002.md`) to `work_orders/completed/`.

## Expected Deliverables/Outputs:
*   All 13 core MJML component `.mjml` files correctly located in `src/mjml-source/components/{category}/`.
*   All 13 core MJML component `.md` documentation files correctly located in `docs/mjml-source/components/{category}/`, with updated `Location:` fields.
*   `README.md` updated to explicitly list `src/mjml-source/components/` and `docs/mjml-source/components/` as the authoritative locations.
*   Incorrect directories (`templates/components/`, `src/mjml_components/`, `docs/components/`) removed if empty or containing only moved files.
*   Active process/guide documentation files updated to reflect the correct component and documentation paths where necessary.
*   A new **Journal Entry** documenting this WO's completion created in the `journal/` directory and indexed in `journal_index.yml`.
*   `tasks.yml` updated for TASK003.
*   A new **Handoff Document** summarizing this WO's completion created in the `Handoff/` directory.
*   This Work Order (`WO002.md`) archived in `work_orders/completed/`.

## Completion Checklist (Cross-reference to Section 4.4 of Work_Order_Process.md):
*   [ ] Primary Deliverables Met (Components/Docs moved, directories cleaned, `README.md`/Active docs updated)
*   [ ] Journal Entry Created (Filename: ____________________)
*   [ ] tasks.yml Updated (Task ID: TASK003 set to done/review)
*   [ ] Handoff Document Created (Filename: ____________________)
*   [ ] WO Archived (Moved to work_orders/completed/)
```

This Work Order is designed to be the definitive command to fix the structural problem caused by the prior inconsistencies. It states the issue directly in the title and objective, clearly defines the correct locations based on our established project direction, mandates the necessary file movements and documentation updates, and strictly adheres to the process outlined in `docs/guides/Work_Order_Process.md`.

This document acknowledges the source of the problems (the previous flawed Work Order and undocumented actions) without altering the historical record, and focuses on creating the correct, documented state moving forward.
