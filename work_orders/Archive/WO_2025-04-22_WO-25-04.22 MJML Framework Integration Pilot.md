# Work Order: MJML Framework Integration Pilot

**Date:** April 2025

**Prepared By:** Gemini AI (based on collaboration with User)

**Goal:** Integrate the MJML email framework into the project workflow to streamline the creation of responsive, Outlook-compatible email templates. This pilot aims to replace the manual HTML/visual editor approach for *template structure generation* for one selected template.

*(Progress Note: This document will be updated to reflect completed milestones and any relevant notes as the pilot proceeds.)*

**Rationale:**
*   Leverage MJML's abstraction layer to reduce manual coding complexity for responsive, table-based layouts.
*   Improve template consistency and maintainability using semantic MJML markup.
*   Align with the preferred IDE-centric workflow (Cursor) for template development.
*   Automate the generation of Outlook-specific compatibility code (VML, conditional comments) for common components.
*   Focus developer effort on design structure (in MJML) and content population (via JSON), reducing time spent on cross-client HTML hacks.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Node.js and npm (or equivalent package manager) installed in the development environment.

## Steps & Milestones

**1. Setup MJML Environment**
    *   **Action:** Verify Node.js and npm are installed and accessible in the terminal (`node -v`, `npm -v`).
    *   **Action:** Install MJML as a local development dependency within the project workspace: `npm install --save-dev mjml`
    *   **Action:** Update `.gitignore` to include `node_modules/`.
    *   **Milestone 1:** MJML successfully installed. Confirm by running `npx mjml --version` from the workspace root. **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26]**

**2. Configure IDE Integration (Cursor/VS Code)**
    *   **Action:** Search for and install the official "MJML" extension by Mjml within the IDE.
    *   **Milestone 2:** MJML extension installed. Confirm by creating a dummy `.mjml` file and verifying syntax highlighting is active. **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26]**

**3. Select Pilot Template**
    *   **Action:** Identify a representative, well-structured HTML email template from the existing project (e.g., from `production/` or `templates/`) to serve as the target for conversion to MJML. **Selected Template: `production/emails/campaigns/Dragon-CoPilot Brevo.html`**
    *   **Milestone 3:** Specific pilot HTML template path identified and confirmed. **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26]**

**4. Rebuild Template in MJML**
    *   **Action:** Create a new directory `templates/mjml-source/`.
    *   **Action:** Create a new file within `templates/mjml-source/` for the pilot template (e.g., `pilot-template.mjml`).
    *   **Action:** Analyze the visual structure and components of the selected pilot HTML template.
    *   **Action:** Translate the template's structure section by section into semantic MJML components (`<mj-body>`, `<mj-section>`, `<mj-column>`, `<mj-image>`, `<mj-text>`, `<mj-button>`, etc.) within the `.mjml` file. Focus initially on layout replication.
    *   **Checkpoint 4.1:** Review the basic MJML structure. Does it semantically represent the original template layout? **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26 - Initial structure created]**
    *   **Action:** Add MJML attributes (`padding`, `background-color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `color`, `href`, `src`, `alt`, etc.) to the MJML tags to match the styling and content placeholders of the original design. Reference MJML documentation (<https://documentation.mjml.io/>) as needed.
    *   **Milestone 4:** MJML source code (`pilot-template.mjml`) is complete, structurally and stylistically matching the core elements of the original pilot HTML template. **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26 - Initial translation done; some elements like gradients/shadows simplified]**

**5. Compile and Review Output**
    *   **Action:** Create a new directory `templates/mjml-compiled/`.
    *   **Action:** Compile the `.mjml` file to HTML using the command line from the workspace root: `npx mjml templates/mjml-source/pilot-template.mjml -o templates/mjml-compiled/pilot-template.html`
    *   **Action:** Review the structure and content of the generated `templates/mjml-compiled/pilot-template.html` file. Compare its complexity (nested tables, VML) to the original hand-coded/exported HTML.
    *   **Checkpoint 5.1:** Visually inspect the compiled HTML file (`pilot-template.html`) by opening it directly in a web browser. Does the rendering visually approximate the original design? **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26]**

**6. Initial Testing & Refinement**
    *   **Action:** Perform basic rendering checks: resize browser window, check in different locally available browsers (if any). **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26 - Visual check in browser]**
    *   **Action:** (Optional, based on availability) Use free tools (like GMail's preview, Outlook web preview if accessible) or a limited Litmus free trial (7 days) to check rendering in key target clients (Outlook Desktop, Gmail Web, iOS Mail). **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26 - Imported to Beefree, checked rendering]**
    *   **Action:** If rendering issues are identified, iterate on the `.mjml` source code, recompile (`npx mjml ...`), and re-test. Consult MJML documentation or project documentation (e.g., `docs/email-fundamentals.md`) for potential solutions. **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26 - Iterated to fix spacing/icon issues]**
    *   **Milestone 6:** Compiled HTML template (`pilot-template.html`) renders acceptably in key target clients based on available testing methods. Major issues resolved. **[COMPLETED - 2024-07-26 - Deemed acceptable despite minor Beefree/Outlook rendering differences]**

## Pilot Notes

*(This section will capture key observations, decisions, or issues encountered during the pilot.)*
* 2024-07-26: Initial MJML translation completed. Simplified some complex CSS from original HTML (e.g., gradients on sections/buttons, box shadows, custom divider icon, dark mode icon swaps) for initial build. These can be refined later if needed.
* 2024-07-26: Significant difficulty and time (~30 min) resolving specific spacing issue below the introductory text block. Required multiple attempts and clarification due to misinterpretation of visual feedback. **Lesson Learned:** A clearer, more precise language or strategy (e.g., explicitly targeting element padding vs. section padding, using visual annotations if possible) is crucial for efficiently communicating visual layout adjustments to avoid similar frustrating delays in the future.
* 2024-07-26: Checkmark icons initially used inline SVG (`data:image/svg+xml`), which disappeared upon import into Beefree. Replaced with hosted PNG images which resolved the issue.
* 2024-07-26: Beefree rendering observations: Feature cards (intended as 2x2) stacked vertically (1, 2, space, 3, 4). Final CTA buttons (intended side-by-side) stacked vertically and centered. This is likely due to Beefree's responsive rendering logic simplifying column layouts for compatibility, deemed acceptable for this pilot.

## Deliverables

*   MJML installed as a local project dependency (updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json`).
*   Updated `.gitignore` file.
*   MJML source file for the pilot template located in `templates/mjml-source/`.
*   Compiled, functional HTML output file for the pilot template located in `templates/mjml-compiled/`.

## Next Steps
*   Review the outcome of the pilot conversion.
*   Discuss the MJML development experience and workflow.
*   Plan potential conversion of other core templates/components.
*   Discuss integrating the MJML compile step into any future build/automation process.
*   Update project documentation (`README.md`, relevant guides) to reflect the new MJML workflow.
