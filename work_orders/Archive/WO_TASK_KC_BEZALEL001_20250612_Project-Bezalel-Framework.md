## 1. Scope & Objective
This Work Order initiates "KingdomCraft - Project Bezalel," a strategic initiative to establish a formal framework for tracking and quantifying effort and value within the KingdomCraft project. The objective is to move beyond simple time tracking to a model that accurately reflects the strategic value delivered through AI-assisted workflows. This framework will consider three key perspectives:
1.  **Client-Facing Communication:** How we articulate the value of our deliverables.
2.  **Internal Value Tracking:** How we quantify our effort, recognizing that AI expertise amplifies value, justifying premium positioning rather than cost reduction.
3.  **Process Improvement:** How we continuously analyze and refine our workflows, personas, and tools for greater efficiency and impact.

## 2. Deliverables
1.  **Effort & Value Philosophy Document:**
    *   **Location:** `docs/guides/Effort_And_Value_Philosophy.md`
    *   **Content:** A foundational document codifying the project's value-centric mindset, as outlined by the USER. It will serve as "common knowledge" for all project personas.

2.  **KingdomCraft Steward Persona Update:**
    *   **File:** `persona_prompts/1. emailforge_project_governor_persona.md`
    *   **Change:** The persona's initialization sequence will be updated to include a mandatory step: reading and internalizing the `Effort_And_Value_Philosophy.md` document.

3.  **Meta-Analysis Framework & Initial Report:**
    *   **Directory:** A new directory `meta_analysis/` will be created.
    *   **Initial Report:** `meta_analysis/MA_20250612_Initial-Governor-Test-Analysis.md`. This report will provide a "zoomed-out" assessment of our recent chat session, the pivot to real-world testing, and the key learnings and process improvements identified.

4.  **Task Tracking Artifacts:**
    *   This Work Order.
    *   The corresponding `TASK_KC_BEZALEL001` entry in `tasks.yml`.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria
*   All specified documents and directories are created and populated with their initial content.
*   The KingdomCraft Steward persona prompt is updated as specified.
*   The `Effort_And_Value_Philosophy.md` document accurately reflects the user's strategic direction.
*   The meta-analysis report provides a clear and insightful assessment of the project's recent evolution.
*   `tasks.yml` is updated with the new task.

## 4. Dependencies
*   Relies on the strategic direction and philosophy provided by the USER in the chat session on 2025-06-12.
